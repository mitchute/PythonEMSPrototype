Python Path Information
=======================

The Python library

This prototype tool (and eventually E+) adds these paths.

Look into allowing more flexible (nested) imports
Actually just test and then give an example of a Python package where:

- There is an pyms_classes.py file at the root of the repository
- There are folders of other PyMS classes
- There are also folders of other meaningful utility functions
- The root pyms_classes.py file is just a list of import statements

This way you can give E+ one path: the path to your EMS package, and every PyMS program will have the path: pyms_classes,class_name
