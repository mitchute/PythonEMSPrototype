Welcome to EnergyPlus PyMS's documentation!

   python

Highest-level overview:

- EnergyPlus is a whole building energy simulation tool.
- PyMS is a Python interface to allow plugging in a Python script to the simulation.
- The PythonEMSPrototype is a C++ project that demonstrates how the implementation will look eventually in EnergyPlus.

Eventually, the prototype tool will be deleted, and the EnergyPlus implementation will fully document the EnergyPlus
workflows.  The PyMS repo will live on, but probably transferred to a different organization.
