Python EMS Workflows
====================

Here's where I'll lay out a few possible workflow designs.

* An E+ user has very little Python experience but wants to scratch together a Python EMS implementation in a single file.
* A user with both E+ and Python experience wants to collect their own library of Python EMS functionality within a file.
* An advanced Python user wants to create a full Python package to be made available for Python EMS work.
