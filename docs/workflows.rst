Python EMS Workflows
====================

This document discusses how a user will interact with the EnergyPlus Python EMS framework.

What even is EMS?
-----------------

Describe how to just use EMS itself, discuss sensors, actuators, programs, calling points.

Entry-Level PyMS Usage
----------------------

An E+ user has very little Python experience but wants to scratch together a Python EMS implementation in a single file.
The example should be extremely small - a single function.

Adding PyMS Intensity
---------------------

A user with both E+ and Python experience wants to collect their own library of Python EMS functionality within a file.
Like adding worker functions that the main function calls.

Full on Sprint
--------------

An advanced Python user wants to create a full Python package to be made available for Python EMS work.
They also want to add dependent Python packages.
